# 🧠 Advancing Talking Head Generation: A Comprehensive Survey of Multi-Modal Methodologies, Datasets, Evaluation Metrics, and Loss Functions

This repository presents an exhaustive survey on **Talking Head Generation (THG)**, authored by **Vineet Kumar Rakesh** as part of a research project conducted at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The paper categorizes Talking Head Generation techniques, reviews key methodologies, datasets, loss functions, evaluation metrics, and provides empirical comparisons of select methods.

## 📌 Abstract

Talking Head Generation aims to synthesize realistic human head videos driven by speech, text, or other videos. This paper surveys key developments in the domain, evaluates them through implementation-based benchmarking, and outlines major challenges in realism, identity retention, and synchronization.
